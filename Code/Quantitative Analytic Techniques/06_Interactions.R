# Setup -------------------------------------------------------------------
# _________________________________________________________________________

# Set working directory
setwd("/Users/jgabry/Desktop/COLUMBIA/Stuff_for_Greg")

# Load some packages
library(QMSS)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)

# Load the GSS cumulative dataset & 2010 subset

# Plot of education vs predicted income comparing men and women 
  # There are many many ways to do this. Here are several:
  
  # Using visreg package
# install.packages("visreg")
library(visreg)
visreg(lm.income, # the model
       xvar = "educ", # variable to plot on x-axis
       xlab = "highest year of school completed", # title for x-axis
       ylab = "Income", # title for y-axis
       by = "female", # plot one line for males and one for females
       overlay = T, # plot the lines for females and males on the same plot instead of two separate ones
       partial = F, # don't plot residuals 
       band = F, # don't plot confidence interval bands,
       legend = F, # don't print legend (we'll add our own)
       cex.axis = 0.7, # shrink the axis annotations (the tick mark labels) a bit
       bty = "l", # draw an L-shaped box around the plot (instead of default which is a full rectangle)
       line = list(col = c("darkcyan", "lightcoral"))) # colors for the lines  
legend("top", c("Males", "Females"), # add a legend to the plot
       lwd = 2, col = c("darkcyan", "lightcoral"), bty = "n")

  # Or using interaction.plot() function
interaction.plot(lm.income$model$educ, lm.income$model$female, lm.income$fitted,
                 col =  c("darkcyan", "lightcoral"), # colors for the lines
                 lty = 1, lwd = 2,
                 legend = F, # don't print a legend (we'll add our own after b/c the default legends are very ugly)
                 xlab = "Highest year of school completed", # captions for the axes
                 ylab = "Income")
legend("bottomright", c("Males", "Females"), col = c("darkcyan", "lightcoral"), lwd = 2)

  # Or for practice we can do the plot manually using the plot() and points() functions
model.dat <- cbind(lm.income$model, xb = lm.income$fitted)

  # plot for females 
  plot(educ[female==T], xb[female==T],

  # Or with ggplot
