\title{Compute fraction of variance due to u_i}
\usage{
rho(fit)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A model fit with \code{\link{lmer}} (\pkg{lme4}).}
}
\value{
A number between 0 and 1. The fraction of variance due to u_i.
}
\description{
Compute fraction of variance due to u_i
}
\details{
Note that in the output from \code{summary(fit)} the Std. Dev. column in the Random Effects section
contains what STATA refers to as sigma_u and sigma_e. STATA also reports rho (fraction of variance due to u_i)
but this is not given in the R output. The \code{rho} function computes this value.
